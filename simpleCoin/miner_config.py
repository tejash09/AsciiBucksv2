"""
Defines constants for a blockchain network.

This module contains constant values used in a blockchain network,
including the miner address, miner node URL, and a list of peer nodes.

Attributes
----------
MINER_ADDRESS : str
    A unique identifier for the miner in the blockchain network.
    It is a string in the format of a cryptographic address.

MINER_NODE_URL : str
    The URL of the miner node, typically the local address where
    the blockchain node is running.

PEER_NODES : list
    An empty list that can be populated with the URLs of other
    peer nodes in the blockchain network.

Notes
-----
These constants are used to configure and connect nodes in a
blockchain network. The MINER_ADDRESS identifies the node responsible
for mining new blocks, and the MINER_NODE_URL is the address where
the miner's node can be accessed. PEER_NODES can be used to maintain
a list of other nodes in the network for communication and
synchronization purposes.
